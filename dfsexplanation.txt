Algorithm Explanation:
The algorithm employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to identify all reachable vertices from each "up" vertex in a directed graph. It initializes an empty dictionary reachable to store the reachable vertices for each "up" vertex.

DFS Function (dfs):

Performs a DFS traversal from a given vertex, marking visited vertices and collecting reachable vertices.
Traverses through neighboring vertices, excluding those marked as "down" and preventing self-referential loops.
Main Function (reachable_vertices):

Iterates through each vertex in the graph.
For each "up" vertex:
Initializes a visited set to track visited vertices during DFS.
Performs DFS from the current vertex, collecting reachable vertices in a reachable_set.
Adds the sorted list of reachable vertices to the reachable dictionary, excluding the vertex itself and self-referential loops.
Time Complexity Analysis:
DFS Traversal:

In the worst case, the DFS algorithm visits each vertex and each edge once.
Let V be the number of vertices and E be the number of edges in the graph.
The time complexity of DFS is O(V + E), as it visits each vertex and edge at most once during traversal.
Building Reachable Dictionary:

The algorithm iterates through each vertex once and performs DFS for each "up" vertex.
Therefore, building the reachable dictionary also has a time complexity of O(V + E), similar to DFS.
Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the directed graph. This complexity arises from both the DFS traversal and the process of collecting and storing reachable vertices for each "up" vertex.
